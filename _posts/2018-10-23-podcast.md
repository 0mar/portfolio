This week I am starring in our university's podcast. [Forskningspodden][1] (also on [iTunes][2]), a podcast hosted by Karlstad University Press, invites their researchers from all areas to introduce and discuss their work.

During a 20 minute session (in English) we talk about some aspects of research in applied mathematics, as well as the contributions in my [licentiate thesis]({% post_url 2018-08-23-licentiate %}). If you are curious, tune in!
