I'm happy to announce that from 2025 onwards, Simula Consulting will be fully integrated into Simula Research Laboratory as the [Department of Applied AI][1]. 

> "This merger represents a step forward in our mission to make deep tech competence from Simula's research groups more accessible to industry. By integrating Simula Consulting more closely with our research units, we aim to foster stronger collaboration and drive innovation at the intersection of academic research and real-world applications," says Simula CEO Lillian RÃ¸stad.


Practically, not much changes for now. We continue with the same team in the same location, and we will continue to offer consultancy and contract research and build R&D collaboration with companies. Strategically, we will focus more on large-scale industry collaboration and innovation projects. 

Moreover, I will continue in my role as chief technology officer at Simula Research Laboratory, widening my scope to all departments at Simula.

If you'd like to discuss potential collaborations, either directly or in a larger consortium, feel free to get in touch. You can find my contact details [here][1].
