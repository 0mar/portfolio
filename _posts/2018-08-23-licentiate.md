## Background

Like some other countries, Sweden has the tradition of a *licentiate degree*, a post-MSc degree classified below a doctoral degree. While not an obligatory step for students pursuing a PhD, some universities use it both as a milestone for the student, and as an opportunity to practice the process of writing and defending a thesis.

The licentiate thesis falls roughly midway in the process of a PhD, and contains the work the student has done up to that point. Its validity will be checked by a small committees: an examiner from the faculty, a referee from elsewhere, and an external professor in the field, who challenges the candidate to defend the work during a public session. More information on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licentiate_(degree)).
