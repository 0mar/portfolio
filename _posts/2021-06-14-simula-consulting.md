Having finished my PhD, it is time for the next step.
On September 1st, I will join [Simula Consulting](https://simula.consulting) (Oslo, Norway) with a full-time position as *Data Scientist*.
Simula Consulting is an R&D consultancy firm that operates under the umbrella of [Simula Research Laboratory](https://simula.no). Among others, it focuses on development of new technologies, specialized education and data analytics.

After my collaboration with [MinRK](github.com/minrk) on JupyterHub, I came in touch with [Valeriya Naumova](https://www.simula.no/people/valeriya), leader of Simula Consulting, who was looking to expand a team of experts in software development, data science and machine learning.
Working on JupyterHub was a pleasure and now that I finished my thesis I want to shift my scope a bit more towards development than research.
Simula Consulting provides this opportunity, being a young high-tech company having strong ties to the research community.

Although my blog will migrate soon, I hope to be able to keep you posted on my activities.
