[SurplusMap](https://www.surplusmap.com) is a Norwegian startup that focuses on data-driven insights in charging infrastructure of electronic vehicles. They collect and provide analytics that help charging station managers to understand how their stations perform and how to optimize future deployments.
We have a longstanding collaboration with SurplusMap, and I am very pleased that we can continue this collaboration via our new innovation project.

# PRESAGE
Together with SurplusMap, we received funding from the Research Council of Norway through the “Regional Research Fund”, which allows us to focus on PRESAGE: Predictive Resource Estimation for Advanced Grid Electromobility.
The goal of PRESAGE is to predict grid load evolution associated with EV charging station, allowing charging station and grid managers to accurately assess how the increase in EVs will affect the electricity grid.

## Project overview and objectives
This project, led by me, will run in 2025 for 5 months. The primary objective of this project is to create a proof-of-concept of the PRESAGE system, ensuring readiness for a larger R&D effort and eventual commercial use. 

## State-of-the-art machine learning for smart grids
The primary objective is to use environmental data, traffic data and charging station occupancy data to make short-term and long-term predictions on grid load. These predictions can be leveraged to plan new charging parks and balance out the growing strain of EVs on the electric grid.
