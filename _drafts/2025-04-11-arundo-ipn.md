[Arundo Analytics](https://www.arundo.com/) is a Norwegian start-up that builds AI-driven solutions to gain insights in industrial operations. Their asset management system, the Arundo Foundation, allows engineers to create and traverse knowledge graphs and extend them with tailormade mathematical and data-driven models that enable anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.

# AIDA
Together with Arundo, we received funding from the Research Council of Norway through the call "Innovation Projects for Industry" (IPN). I will lead the scientific efforts of the AIDA project: Towards AI-Driven Autonomous Industrial Operations.
With this project, we aim to make significant strides towards enabling more autonomous, efficient, and data-driven industrial environments.

# Project objectives
One of the deliverables of this project is a conversational, AI-powered interface designed to support asset operators in real-time decision-making. 
This interface will take the shape of an intelligent assistant (AI Companion) that goes beyond the traditional dashboard paradigm. Instead of navigating complex analytics tools or scripting queries, operators will be able to interact with the AI Companion using natural language. Questions such as “Why did pump 4 shut down?”, or, “What will energy usage look like if throughput is increased by 10%?” can be posed directly, with the system delivering clear, reliable, and context-aware answers.

This project is an opportunity to bring AI directly into the operational flow. Our goal is to empower the people closest to industrial processes by giving them tools that translate data into immediate, actionable intelligence — all through intuitive interaction

# AI development
The AI Companion will leverage advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Industrial Knowledge Graphs (IKGs) to interpret sensor data, reason about causal relationships, and provide insights tailored to the needs of critical infrastructure operations. This hybrid architecture ensures that the information presented is both technically robust and operationally relevant.

This effort reflects a broader movement towards more human-centric AI in high-stakes environments, enabling seamless integration of advanced technologies into everyday decision-making.

As industrial systems evolve towards greater autonomy and intelligence, the ability to interact with data naturally and meaningfully will become central to operational success. Simula’s AI Companion represents a step towards that future, making critical knowledge available not just to analysts and engineers, but to every operator on the ground.
Together, with the support of the RCN, and with the coordination of Arundo on this project, we aim to further more insight-driven, responsive, and sustainable industry operations.
