# Recent projects
My host institute is [Simula](https://simula.no), where I work with a team of data scientists and research engineers. The [department of Applied AI](https://www.simula.no/services/applied-ai) works with both industry and public sector to solve urgent problems with innovative solutions. Below are a few projects I contributed to.
